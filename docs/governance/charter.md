<ol type="1">
  <li><b>Mission and Scope of the OpenWallet Foundation.</b><br/>
  <br/>
    The purpose of the OpenWallet Foundation (the “OWF”) is to support various open source, open data and/or other open projects relating to or supporting development of digital wallets, including infrastructure and support initiatives related thereto (each such project, a “Technical Project”) , in accordance with the provisions of this Charter. The governance of each Technical Project is as set forth in the charter for that Technical Project.<br/>
  <br/>
    The OWF aims to enable entities to transact securely, and in a privacy enhancing fashion, in- person and on-line where attributes stored in, and managed by, the wallet. The OWF will:<br/>
  <br/>
    <ul>
      <li>develop and maintain open source code for wallets to enable and ensure wallet interoperability,</li>
      <li>advocate for the adoption of the interoperable digital wallet technology, and</li>
      <li>collaborate with Standards Development Organizations (SDOs) in the development and proliferation of open standards related to digital wallets</li>
    </ul>
  <br/>
    The OWF will not publish a publicly available wallet (including into any application stores).<br/>
  <br/>
    The OWF supports the Technical Projects. The OWF operates under the guidance of the Governing Board of the OWF (the “Governing Board”) and Linux Foundation Europe (the “LFEU”) as may be consistent with Linux Foundation Europe’s tax-exempt status.<br/>
  <br/>
    The Governing Board manages the OWF. The Governing Board may establish other committees and other working groups (collectively, and including the Technical Advisory Council, “Committees”) which will report to the Governing Board.
  </li>
  <li><b>Sponsorship.</b></li>
    <ol type="a">
      <li>The OWF will be composed of Premier, General and Associate Sponsors (each, a “Sponsor” and, collectively, the “Sponsors”) in Good Standing. All Sponsors must be current Sponsors of LFEU (at any level) to participate in the OWF as a Sponsor. All sponsors in the OWF, enjoy the privileges and undertake the obligations described in this Charter, as from time-to-time amended by the Governing Board, with the approval of LFEU. During the term of their sponsorship, all Participants will comply with all such policies as the LFEU Board of Directors and/or the OWF may adopt with notice to Sponsors.</li>
      <li>Premier Sponsors will be entitled to appoint a representative to the Governing Board and any Committee.</li>
      <li>General Sponsors, acting as a class, will be entitled to annually elect one representative to the Governing Board for every ten General Sponsors, up to a maximum of three total representatives, provided that there will always be at least one General Sponsor representative, even if there are less than ten General Sponsors. The Governing Board determines the General Sponsor representative election process.</li>
      <li>The Associate Sponsor category of sponsorship is limited to Associate Sponsors of LFEU. The Governing Board may set additional criteria for sponsoring the OWF as an Associate Sponsor. If the Associate Sponsor is itself a membership or participation organization, Associate Sponsorship in the OWF does not confer any privileges or rights to the members or participants of the Associate Sponsor.</li>
      <li>Sponsors will be entitled to:</li>
        <ol type="i">
          <li>participate in OWF general meetings, initiatives, events and any other activities; and</li>
          <li> identify themselves as sponsors of the OWF supporting the OWF community.</li>
        </ol>
    </ol>
  <li><b>Governing Board</b></li>
    <ol type="a">
      <li>The Governing Board voting members will consist of:</li>
        <ol type="i">
          <li>one representative appointed by each Premier Sponsor;</li>
          <li>the TAC Representative (as defined below), or, in the absence of a chair and with the approval of the Governing Board, any active contributor to a Technical Project so designated by the TAC (such chair or designee the “TAC Representative”); and</li>
          <li>the elected General Sponsor representative or representatives.</li>
        </ol>
      <li>The Governing Board will also include nonvoting members consisting of the GAC Representative (defined in Section 4) and Associate Representative.</li>
        <ol type="i">
          <li>The Associate Representative will be chosen based on their efforts and potential to advance the OWF mission. The Associate Representative will be selected by the Governing Board voting representatives through a process determined by the Governing Board.</li>
        </ol>
      <li>Only one Sponsor that is part of a group of Related Companies (as defined in Section 7) may appoint, or nominate for a sponsorship class election, a representative on the Governing Board. No single Sponsor, company or set of Related Companies will be entitled to: (i) appoint or nominate for sponsorship class election more than one representative for the Governing Board, or (ii) have more than two representatives on the Governing Board.</li>
        <ol type="i">
          <li>The only path to two representatives from the same group of Related Companies that will be acceptable will be for one Sponsor to appoint or nominate a representative to the Governing Board and have another of its employees, or an employee of one of its Related Companies, serve as the TAC Representative on the Governing Board.</li>

    <ol type="a">
      <li>The Government Advisory Council (the “GAC”) will provide the OWF advice from government entities approved to participate by the Governing Board. Members of the GAC must be national governments, multinational governmental organizations and treaty organizations, or public authorities. Each may appoint one representative and one alternate representative to the GAC. There are no fees to participate in the GAC.</li>

The GAC chairperson or another person chosen by the GAC chairperson will serve as the “GAC Representative” responsible for reporting progress back to the Governing Board and interfacing with the TAC. The GAC Representative may attend meetings of the Governing Board and TAC as a non-voting member.</li>
    </ol>
  <li><b>Technical Advisory Council</b></li>
    <ol type="a">
      <li>The role of the TAC is to facilitate communication and collaboration among the Technical Projects. The TAC will be responsible for:</li>
        <ol type="i">
          <li>maintaining an overall strategic vision for technical collaboration and coordinating collaboration among Technical Projects, including development of an overall technical vision for the community;</li>
          <li>making recommendations to the Budget Committee of resource priorities for Technical Projects;</li>
          <li>electing annually a chairperson to preside over meetings, set the agenda for meetings, ensure meeting minutes are taken and who will also serve on the Governing Board as the TAC’s representative (the “TAC Representative”);</li>
          <li>creating, maintaining and amending project lifecycle procedures and processes, deciding where Technical Projects fall within that lifecycle;</li>
          <li>determining when a technical project should be admitted as a Technical Project or any Technical Project should be considered a TAC Project; and</li>
          <li>such other matters related to the technical role of the TAC as may be communicated to the TAC by the Governing Board.</li>
        </ol>
      <li>The voting members of the TAC consist of:</li>

          <li>one representative appointed by each Premier Sponsor;</li>
          <li>up to two “at large” representatives appointed by vote of the TAC; and</li>
          <li>one representative appointed by the technical oversight body (e.g., a technical steering committee) of each TAC Project (as defined herein).</li>
        </ol>
      <li>TAC meetings are intended to be open to observe by Sponsors, contributors to any TAC Project and others in the general public interested in the OpenWallet Foundation.</li>
      <li>At the start of the OWF, “TAC Projects” are those Technical Projects listed as having voting representatives on the TAC on the Directed Fund’s web site. Thereafter, any Technical Project can become a TAC Project through the approval of the Technical Project’s technical oversight body and the TAC (by a two-third’s vote). The TAC may approve and modify a project lifecycle policy that will address the incubation, archival and other stages of TAC Projects.</li>
      <li>The TAC representatives will elect a chair to preside over meetings, ensure minutes are taken and drive the TAC agenda with input from the TAC representatives.</li>
    </ol>
  <li><b>Voting</b></li>
    <ol type="a">
      <li>Quorum for Governing Board and Committee meetings will require at least fifty percent of the voting representatives. If advance notice of the meeting has been given per normal means and timing, the Governing Board may continue to meet even if quorum is not met, but will be prevented from making any decisions at the meeting.</li>
      <li>Ideally decisions will be made based on consensus. If, however, any decision requires a vote to move forward, the representatives of the Governing Board or Committee, as applicable, will vote on a one vote per voting representative basis.</li>
      <li>Except as provided in Section 14.a. or elsewhere in this Charter, decisions by vote at a meeting will require a simple majority vote, provided quorum is met. Except as provided in Section 14.a. or elsewhere in this Charter, decisions by electronic vote without a meeting will require a majority of all voting representatives.</li>
      <li>In the event of a tied vote with respect to an action that cannot be resolved by the Governing Board, the Chair may refer the matter to the LFEU for assistance in reaching a decision. If there is a tied vote in any Committee that cannot be resolved, the matter may be referred to the Governing Board.</li>
