## Vacancies

### TAC Chair Vacancy
Should the TAC Chair seat become vacant, the vacancy will be filled by using the original selection method for that seat and the replacement will serve the remainder of the original term.

### TAC "At Large" Representative Vacancy
Should a TAC "at large" representative seat become vacant, the vacancy will be filled at the next indicative election, by electing a person for a full new term, not by serving out the vacant term.

!!! info
    The reason that the TAC "at large" vacancy is not filled immediately is that the charter does not specify a lower limit for TAC "at large" representatives; it only specifies an upper limit.
