The TAC will undertake an annual review of all OpenWallet Foundation projects. This annual review will include an assessment as to whether:

* each Lab is active and making adequate progress towards the Growth Stage
* each Growth Stage project is making adequate progress towards the Impact Stage
* each Impact Stage project is maintaining progress to remain at the Impact Stage

The suggested time frame for the review is to start on September 1st and be completed by October 31st with a set of recommendations for each project to improve and/or a recommendation to move a project across stages.

Projects can be provided with an extension of time in their current stage (up to the discretion of the TAC).

The [project lifecycle](project-lifecycle.md) contains Acceptance Criteria for moving a project to a new stage.
